I joined Nichols College as [Assistant Professor of Environmental Science](https://www.nichols.edu/faculty/panday-prajjwal) in the Fall of 2016. I earned my Ph.D in Geography from the [Clark Graduate School of Geography](https://www.clarku.edu/departments/geography/) and my Masters in Environmental Science from the [SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry](https://www.esf.edu/environmentalscience/gpes/). I received my Bachelor's in Science degree in Chemistry and Environmental Studies from [St. Lawrence University](https://www.stlawu.edu/).

I am a broadly trained geographer with expertise in environmental modeling, hydro-climatology, remote sensing, and geospatial technologies. My research and intellectual interests focuses on using a systems approach to determine linkages between climate variability, anthropogenic changes, and land-water interactions. My research utilizes field-based observations, satellite remote sensing, geospatial data, and process-based modeling to understand terrestrial and hydrological processes across various spatial and temporal scales. Much of my work thus far has focused on the monitoring and modeling of various components of the hydrological cycle in some of the fastest changing regions of the world such as the Himalayas as well as the Amazon. I am also currently working with local watershed organizations and the City of Worcester to install water quality monitoring stations in the Tatnuck Watershed.
