I am committed to the pursuit and sharing of knowledge of the highest excellence. I have taught the required science course ESCI 243 (Physical World) each semester since Fall semester of 2016 including one online session each summer. Along with this course, I have developed and taught other courses which include ECON 309 (World Economic Geography), MGMT 370 Sustainable Management, and ESCI 270 (Resource Management). More recently, I have redesigned and taught a hybrid graduate course MBA 734 (Statistical Modeling using R).
